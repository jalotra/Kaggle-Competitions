# Kaggle-Competitions

### This repo lists all the competitions that I have participated in. 

### Pre-requisites 

1. I know some Machine-Learning and I have taken Machine-Learning-By-AndrewNg Course.
2. Will try to learn all the things along the way.
3. Some things to focus on : 
	1. How to deal with data ? 
	2. How to make data more clearer ? 
	3. Learn all the tricks to get rid of outliers ?
	4. I don't know the working of tree based models so I have to learn about them more indepth.
	5. Some models that I want to learn about -- Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree. 

4. I will be trying to complete 5 machine-learning projects with indepth know-how.
5. All these projects will not use deep-learning for now, as I want to focus more on the cleaning the data, feature selection, EDA more.
6. It is going to be a 30 Days Kaggle Challenge.


### Resources 
1. Kaggle-Learn 
2. Approaching Almost Any Machine Learning Problem Book . 
3. Will add the resources here as I get more. 

### Projects-Sections
1. Predicting a Biologocal Response. Lets see what a SVM can get me.
